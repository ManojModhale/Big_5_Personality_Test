# Big 5 Personality Test Frontend

## Overview

**Big 5 Personality Test** is an online tool that allows users to evaluate their personality based on the Five-Factor Model (FFM). The test measures five key personality traits:

- **Openness**: Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, and unusual ideas.
- **Conscientiousness**: Tendency to be organized, dependable, and disciplined.
- **Extraversion**: Tendency to be sociable, outgoing, and energetic.
- **Agreeableness**: Tendency to be compassionate, cooperative, and friendly.
- **Neuroticism**: Tendency to experience emotional instability, anxiety, and mood swings.

This repository contains the frontend built with Angular, featuring a user-friendly interface that guides users through the test and displays the results. The test questions and images are fetched from local JSON files, and the app uses various services to manage test timing, fetching questions, and sending user responses to the backend.
The app communicates with a Spring Boot backend running on port `8182` for fetching test questions, sending user answers, and retrieving results.
